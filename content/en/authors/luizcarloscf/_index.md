## About me

Hi there, I'm an electrical engineering undergraduate student at [UFES](https://www.ufes.br/). In 2018, I joined some research groups at [LabVisio](https://viros.ufes.br/). Some research topics are:

- Cloud computing
- Computer vision
- Digital image processing
- Robotics

I'm more involved in cloud computing projects, studying tools like Kubernetes, Docker, Ansible. Most of the time programming in Python. Recently, I joined [ISVision](https://isvision.com.br) with the proposal to help design a backend system for image processing.

## About this website

I try to log down my learnings about containers, Kubernetes, Docker, programming, etc (and also practice writing in English).
