    * **Jul 09**: New Conference Paper! Check out [Voice Commands Authentication for Mobile Robots Navigation in Programmable Intelligent Spaces with Speaker Recognition](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/11066097), where we proposed a system for hierarchical control of a mobile robot based on voice commands, employing the ECAPA-TDNN model for speaker identification and reidentification.

    * **Dec 13**: New Conference Paper! Check out [An Approach Based on a Programmable Intelligent Space for Human-robot Interaction](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10786431), where we proposed a set of services that enable 3D pose estimation, mobile robot navigation, and human-robot interaction. We also developed a simple decision-tree classifier for gesture recognition and robot control.

    * **Feb 27**: Began my Master’s degree in Electrical Engineering at the Federal University of Espírito Santo (UFES), focusing on computer vision and human action and gesture recognition.
