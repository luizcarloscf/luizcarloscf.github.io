Originally introduced by Karl Weierstrass (1891) and rediscovered decades later by Durand (1960) and Kerner (1966), the method remains important in computational algebra and scientific computing.\nAlgorithm # Given a polynomial \\( p(x) \\) of degree \\( n \\), e.g.\n$$ p(x) = ax^4 + bx^3 + cx^2 + dx + e $$where, the values \\(a, b, c, d, e\\) are known coefficients. Although polynomials can be expressed in terms of their roots,\n$$p(x) = (x-P)(x-Q)(x-R)(x-S) $$where, the root values \\(P, Q, R, S\\) are unknown and must be computed. The Durand–Kerner method starts from the idea of isolating each root:\n$$ P = x - \\frac{p(x)}{(x-Q)(x-R)(x-S)} $$ $$ Q = x - \\frac{p(x)}{(x-P)(x-R)(x-S)} $$ $$ R = x - \\frac{p(x)}{(x-P)(x-Q)(x-S)} $$ $$ S = x - \\frac{p(x)}{(x-P)(x-Q)(x-R)} $$Using fixed-point iteration, we update each root estimate:\n$$ P_{n+1} = x - \\frac{p(x)}{(x-Q_n)(x-R_n)(x-S_n)} $$ $$ Q_{n+1} = x - \\frac{p(x)}{(x-P_n)(x-R_n)(x-S_n)} $$ $$ R_{n+1} = x - \\frac{p(x)}{(x-P_n)(x-Q_n)(x-S_n)} $$ $$ S_{n+1} = x - \\frac{p(x)}{(x-P_n)(x-Q_n)(x-R_n)} $$Because each expression is independent, each root uses its own value as the next iteration point:\n$$ P_{n+1} = P_n - \\frac{p(P_n)}{(P_n-Q_n)(P_n-R_n)(P_n-S_n)} $$ $$ Q_{n+1} = Q_n - \\frac{p(Q_n)}{(Q_n-P_n)(Q_n-R_n)(Q_n-S_n)} $$ $$ R_{n+1} = R_n - \\frac{p(R_n)}{(R_n-P_n)(R_n-Q_n)(R_n-S_n)} $$ $$ S_{n+1} = S_n - \\frac{p(S_n)}{(S_n-P_n)(S_n-Q_n)(S_n-R_n)} $$This produces a simultaneous root-refinement scheme: each iteration updates all root estimates based on the current ones. A practical challenge, however, is the choice of initial guesses. The method converges rapidly if roots start near their true values, but how should they be chosen? In the following implementation, we are going to explore a solution that implements the algorithm described with a strategy to select good start points.\nPython implementation # The following python implementation can be downloaded with a Jupyter Notebook here.\nStart point selection # A common strategy is to distribute initial values evenly around a circle in the complex plane. In some approaches, some authors discuss methods to estimate the circle radius. Here, we will simplify and use only a circle of radius always equal to 1.\ndef distribute_points(degree: np.ndarray) -\u0026gt; np.ndarray: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34;Distribute initial roots in an unit circle in the complex plane. Parameters ---------- degree: nd.ndarray Polynomial degree. Returns ------- result: nd.ndarray Complex array with initial roots distributed. \u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34; roots = np.zeros(degree, dtype=complex) img = complex(0, 1) rad = 1 phi = 2.0 * np.pi / degree for k in range(degree): roots[k] = complex(rad, 0) * np.exp(img*complex(phi*k, 0.0)) return roots This comes from the polar representation of complex numbers:\n$$z = re^{i \\varphi}$$ Figure 1 - Complex number illustration. Knowing the degree of the polynomial, we know how many roots there are. Then, we compute the step size we should take between \\(0\\) and \\(2\\pi\\) to evenly space the initial roots.\nFixed point iteration # The implementation of Durand-Kerner method using fixed point iteration can be seen below. The following steps can be highlighted:\nInitialize root guesses around the complex unit circle. For each iteration: Update each root using the Durand–Kerner formula. Replace old roots with new approximations. Stop when convergence tolerance or maximum iterations is reached. def durand_kerner(func, degree: int, iterations: int = 10, epsilon: float = 1.0e-16) -\u0026gt; np.ndarray: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34;Durand-kerner root finding algorithm. Parameters ---------- func: Callback function to evaluate polynomial. degree: int Polynomial degree. iterations: int Maximmum number of iterations. epsilon: float Limit to accept convergence. Returns ------- np.ndarray Founded roots. \u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34; roots = distribute_points(degree=degree) n = degree new_roots = np.zeros(n, dtype=complex) for iterations in range(iterations): for k in range(n): denominator = complex(1,0) for i in range(n): if i != k: denominator *= (roots[k] - roots[i]) new_roots[k] = roots[k] - (func(roots[k])/denominator) roots[:] = new_roots return new_roots Results # Below, the computed roots are plotted as red points on the complex plane on top of the magnitude surface of the polynomial:\nFigure 2 - Polynomial results in complex plane. With the selected initialization strategy, the method converges correctly. Some polynomials, especially those with clustered or multiple roots, may require refined initialization strategies for reliable convergence.\nConclusion # The Durand–Kerner method is a simple, elegant algorithm for locating all roots of a polynomial simultaneously, including complex ones. With appropriate initial values, it converges rapidly and can be implemented in only a few lines of Python. However, to make the algorithm more robust good solutions to distribute to initial roots in the complex plane are required.\nReferences # VELIZ, Oscar. Durand-kerner method. Youtube, 2019.
