The website is built with Hugo, a fast and flexible static site generator written in Go. The project is version-controlled with Git and hosted on GitHub Pages, with GitHub Actions automating the deployment workflow. The site is designed with a focus on minimalism, readability, and accessibility. In addition to serving as a portfolio, it also functions as a space for sharing insights on machine learning, computer vision, research tools, and open-source development.\nTools: Hugo, Git, GitHub, GitHub Actions, GitHub Pages Face Detector Microservice # labvisio/is-face-detector Face Detector Service Python 0 1 A microservice integrated into the Intelligent Space Platform for face detection in images. It was developed in Python, containerized with Docker, and deployed on a Kubernetes cluster. To ensure standardized and efficient communication between services, the system employs Protocol Buffers (Protobuf) as the data serialization format. The microservice interacts with the Intelligent Space through a RabbitMQ message broker: it creates a dedicated queue, establishes a binding with the exchange where images are published, and then sends the detection results back to the same exchange. This design enables scalable and asynchronous message handling across distributed components of the platform.\nTools: Python, Shell Script, YAML, RabbitMQ, Protocol Buffers, Docker, Kubernetes, Git, GitHub ","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/projects/","section":"Welcome to luizcarloscf's portfolio! 🎉","summary":"","title":"Projects","type":"page"},{"content":"My current research interests span the fields of Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence, Computer Vision, Pose Estimation, Action/Gesture Recognition.
